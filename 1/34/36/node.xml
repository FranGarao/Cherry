    <rich_text>What is Redis?
Redis (REmote DIctionary Server) is an open-source advanced NoSQL key-value data store used as a
database, cache, and message broker. The data is stored in a dictionary format having key-value pairs. It is
typically used for short term storage of data that needs fast retrieval. Redis does backup data to hard drives
to provide consistency.

The server
Redis runs as server-side software so its core functionality is in its server component. The server listens for
connections from clients, programmatically or through the command-line interface.
-sV : Probe open ports to determine service/version info
The CLI
The command-line interface (CLI) is a powerful tool that gives you complete access to Redisâ€™s data and its
functionalities if you are developing a software or tool that needs to interact with it.
Database
The database is stored in the server's RAM to enable fast data access. Redis also writes the contents of the
database to disk at varying intervals to persist it as a backup, in case of failure.
